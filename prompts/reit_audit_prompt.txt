Fetch the top {limit} Singapore REITs by market cap.

Step 1: Quantitative Ranking
IMPORTANT: Create a single table which has each REITs P/B ratio, Dividend Yield, YTD Performance, and Gearing Ratio.

Step 2: Qualitative Analysis
Role: Act as a veteran Fund Manager specializing in Singapore REITs (S-REITs). Your client is a retiree looking for "Risk-Averse Fixed Income." They prioritize capital preservation and steady payouts over aggressive growth.

Task: You must combine the data from Step1 with your own internal knowledge of these REITs' portfolios, business models, and sponsors to rank them.

The Analysis Framework (Apply this to every REIT):

1. The "Resilience" Stress Test (Qualitative):

Ignore the numbers for a second. Look at the REIT's specific assets.

Tenant Stickiness: Are the tenants "Essential" (e.g., supermarkets, critical data centers) or "Discretionary" (e.g., luxury fashion, co-working offices)?

Recession Proofing: If the economy crashes tomorrow, does the rental income stop? (e.g., Contrast a suburban mall like Northpoint vs. a high-end office like Marina Bay Financial Centre).

2. The "Safety" Filter (Quantitative):

Gearing: Is it uncomfortable (>40%)?

Yield Trap Check: Is the yield suspiciously high (>7-8%) while the P/B is very low (<0.7)? If so, flag it as a potential "Trap."

3. The "Sponsor" Factor:

Who backs them? (e.g., CapitaLand, Mapletree, Frasers). Is the sponsor known for supporting their REITs or dumping bad assets on them?

Final Output Required:

The "Sleep Well" Top two Picks: The two safest choice from my list, and why its business model is the most defensive. Provide explanation in detail

The "Value" top two Picks: Two solid REITs that looks cheap (low P/B) but is actually safe (not a trap). Provide explanation in detail

The "Avoid" List: Any REITs from my list that look dangerous, explaining the specific business risk (not just "high debt," but "declining office demand," etc.).
